# Java
A lot of java code from a few non-sensitive projects (Either training, personal work, non confidential work)
All pictures are from projects in progress or old screenshot of said projects (But I won't lie, I'm no designer, it still ugly but fonctional)
Back-ends are either done using Silex or ExpressJS in their latest version (Always up to date, captain !)
