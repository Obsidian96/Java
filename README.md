# Java
A lot of java code from a few non-sensitive projects (Either training, personal work, non confidential work)
All pictures are from projects in progress (But I won't lie, I'm no designer, it's  a little ugly but fonctional)
Back-ends are either done using Silex or ExpressJS in their latest version (Always up to date, captain !) Some of the backend code is available here: https://github.com/Obsidian96/backend
